Change Log:

This document lists all changes and refactoring made that either:
add new features, break the old API or fix known bugs.  There will
often be many more source code changes that aren't listed if they don't
change the behavior in any public API classes.  The order of changes is mostly
chronological so the most important changes may not always be ordered first.


================
Jillion 5.0
================

New Features
------------

1. Added LucyVectorSpliceTrimmer that performs vector splice trimming using 
   a simplified version of the algorithm that the TIGR program Lucy used.

API Changes
-----------

1. Added Java 8 Lambda Support to many APIs.

2. Moved quality trimming classes that used to be in org.jcvi.jillion.core.qual.trim to new
   org.jcvi.jillion.trim package.  LucyQualityTrimmer moved to new org.jcvi.jillion.trim.lucy

Bug Fixes
----------
1. Generate 454 Universal Accession number did not
   generate valid id if the location x,y coordinate was very small.

================
Jillion 4.2
================

New Features
------------

1.  Renamed *FastaRecordWriter* to *FastaWriter* to make smaller class names

2.  AminoAcid - Added Pyrrolysine 'O' to AminoAcid class and AminoAcidSequence
    as well as Blosum matrices. 
    
3.  FastaFileParser - now supports non-redundant fasta files (parsing only)

Bug Fixes
----------

1.  AlnFileParser - added lowercase basecall support which is used in MAFFT output.
                    Jillion can now successfully parse .aln files produced by MAFFT.
    
2.  XMLBlastParser - If accession in subject is "No definition line found" will
                     use subjectDefline instead.
                     
3.  PrimerDetector - Added guard clause if input sequence is empty, 
                     then empty collection of hits is returned.
                    
API Changes
-----------

1.  Blast- BlastHit now has subjectDefline field instead of
           subjectDeflineComment which only used to have the comment.
           
2.  BtabWriter - now puts alignment length in previously skipped column

================
Jillion 4.1 - internal release only
================

New Features
------------

1.  Added support for AminoAcid ambiguity codes in AminoAcid class AminoAcidSequence
    as well as Blosum matrices. 
    
2.  Added support for Amino Acid 'U' Selenocystenine.

API Changes
-----------

1.  removed getNucleotideSequenceBuilder from AssembledReadBuilder since we want
    to control all sequence manipulations directly to keep read ranges in sync.
    
2.  Added method CoverageRegion.getLength() to avoid having to chain region.asRange().getLength()
 
3.  Moved Frame class to residue package.

4.  Added new class NucleotideSequencePermuter

5.  Improved Javadoc

Bug Fixes
---------
1.  Changed alignment resource loading from loading file to loading inputStream.
    Getting the resource as a file doesn't work once Jillion has been jarred up.
    
2.  Modified AceContigBuilder and AceReadBuilder to callback to it's parent
    builder to update contig left and right if the read size changes.
    
3.  added code to (Hopefully) stop validating the DTD which was
    DDOS'ing NCBI when this code was used on the grid.
    
4.  FastqFileParser - Bug fix for unindexed Casava 1.8 read ids.

5.  AceContigBuilder - Bug fix for inserting bases in ace contig that extend beyond original consensus

================
Jillion 4.0 RC 5 - Added support for indexed BAM files and improvemented SAM/BAM API.
                   Bug fixes and performance improvements.  Added more javadoc.
================

API Changes
-----------
1.  Moved many previously public classes in SAM and BAM packages to be in "internal" packages.
    Which are not intended to be used by external clients.  This greatly simplifies the public facing API.

2.  Added BAM index support for reading and writing.  This includes support for BAM "metadata" records
    which are not in the SAM specification but are created and used by both samtools and Picard.

3.  Added FastqQualityCodec.getOffset() method to get the integer offset for the encoding.  This will
    return 33 or 64 depending on the implementation. 

Bug Fixes
----------
1.  Fixed bug in BAM VirtualFileOffset computation so it matches Picard.  The bug was 
    related to computing the offset at a BGZF block boundary.  Picard sets the offset
    to the beginning of the next block.
    
Performance Improvements
------------------------
1. Improved BAM parsing and writing code to be 25% faster.  Some of these improvements
   might also improve cas file parsing. 

================
Jillion 4.0 RC 4 - Added SAM/BAM and MAQ bfa and bfq support.  Promoted pairwise alignment code out of experimental
                   and into production. Bug fixes and performance improvements.
================

API Changes
------------
1. Added new NucleotideSequenceBuilder constructor that takes a char[]

2. Added append/insert/prepend methods to NucleotideSequenceBuilder that take a char[]

3. Completely changed interfaces for parsing with Visitors.  
   Followed the AceHandler design but renamed methods.  
   XFileParser classes are now factories to create instances of XParser interface.
   XParser has (usually) 3 methods: parse(XVisitor), parse(XVisitor, XMemento) and canParse().
   parse() is the new name for accept().  canParse() returns a boolean to say 
   if a call to parse(...) will throw IllegalStateException.  
   This is because some implementations such as file parsers using an
   inputStream can only call parse() once.  
   
   Any additional calls to parse(...) will fail since we can't always rewind the Stream.
   The will decouple visiting from an actual file so we could visit off of other
   types of objects (like Contig objects in tests).
   
4.  Changed all class references from XFileParser to XParser objects.

5.  Changed FastaFileBuilders to try to create input File's parent directory if does not exist,
    this made the contructor throw IOException instead of FileNotFoundException.
    
6.  Moved alignment packages out of experimental and into main.  New package is org.jcvi.jillion.align.

    Refactored pairwise alignment code to use more intent revealing PairwiseAlignmentBuilder 
    class with 2 static factory methods: createNucleotideAlignment( ..) and createProteinAlignment(..)
    to handle all the messy generics.  Builder has method to specify local vs global alignment 
    to hide algorithm name implementation details.
    
    Added support for Protein Blast results as well as code to auto-detect
    nucleotide or protein blast results to build the correct HSPs.
    
    Renamed ScoringMatrix to SubstitutionMatrix.  Created NucleotideSubsitutionMatrices utility classes.
    Refactored matrix file parser classes into abstract class with 2 subclasses to handle nucleotide and protein matrices.
    moved more classes into align package.

7.  Renamed AminoAcidSequence to ProteinSequence.  
    All other public classes with AminoAcidSequence in their name is now ProteinSequence instead.
    For example: AminoAcidFastaRecord is now called ProteinFastaRecord.

8.  Added new methods to fastaWriterBuilders #lineSeparator(String) to change line separator from \n to
    support windows and #allBasesOnOneLine() to force all data on one line instead of splitting the data onto multilines.
    
9.  made CompactProteinSequenceCodec package private.

10. Changed cas parser to default to fasta format type for unknown file extension or file without extension. 
    Previously default was chromatogram.  Chromatograms now must have either 'ab1', 'abi', 'scf' or 'ztr' file extensions.
    
11. Added getters and setters to Range.Builder previously only had expand and contract.

12. Created AlnWriter interface and AlnFileWriter classes to handle writing nucleotide and protein aln files.

13. Added Support for reading SAM and BAM formatted files. 
    SamHeader, Cigar, SamRecord, ReadGroups, SamAttributes etc all have object representations.
     
14.  Added new method Range.complement(Collection<Range> ) which will return Ranges in the input collection that are not in "this" Range.

15. Made Range.complementFrom(Collection<Range> ) package private since it is not used anymore outside of the Range class
    and is confusing since there are other complement methods.
    
16. Created new AssemblyTransformer interface which will be used to convert from one format into another. 
    Created CasAssemblyTransformationService to convert cas files into something else using AssemblyTransformer.
    Created ConsedAssemblyTransformerBuilder for transforming assemblies into consed packages. 
    (Passing the built assemblyTransformer from this class into the CasAssemblyTransformationService 
    will perform a cas2consed conversion.)
    
17. Created new class DataStoreEntry which is similar to MapEntry<String, T>. 
    Added new method to Datastore.entryIterator() which returns a StreamingIterator<DataStoreEntry<T>>.

18.  Added methods isReadOnceOnly() and isReadOnceOnly() and canCreateMemento() to  FastaParser and FastqParser
     interface to distinguish between file-based and inputStream based datasources.  This may be added to all
     other parsers eventually.

19.  Modified all fasta and fastq DataStore implementations to accept Parser instances in addition to file and inputStream.

20.  Added support for MAQ binary fasta (.bfa) and binary fastq (.bfq) formatted files.
     Maq binary fasta and fastq datastore classes delegate to their nucleotide fasta and fastq counterparts by 
     just passing their BinaryParser isntance to them for improved code re-use.
     
21.  FastqFileWriter now has a includeIdOnQualDefLine( boolean) method to add the ids to the quality defline. Some
     legacy external fastq pipelines require seeing the id on both the sequence and quality deflines so this is to support them.
     
     

Bug Fixes
------------
1. Fixed bug in QualitySequenceBuilder AND AminoAcidSequenceBuilder where trimming beyond current Range threw Exception.

2. Changed AbstractAceContigBuilderVisitor to get valid range ONLY from QA align coordinates instead of intersection.
   This solves problem of user edited read extensions not getting parsed correctly.
   
3. Fixed bug in NucleotideSequenceBuilder that didn't treat \t as a whitespace character.

4. Changed NucleotideSequenceBuilder to ignore \0 in char arrays.

5. Fixed bug in XML BLAST parser to call visitEnd() at end of file.

6. Major Bug fix in ResidueSequence.isGap() which didn't work for the NucleotideCodecs
   if the offset requested was the first gap in the read! 


Performance Improvements
------------------------
1.  Added optional fastqCodec field to AbstractAlignedCasReadVisitor so
    fastq files included in cas assemblies don't have to be parsed twice to guess encoding.
2.  Increased use of StringBuilders instead of String concatentation. Set large initial buffer sizes
    to avoid as many re-sizing operations.

================
Jillion 4.0 RC 3 - Most changes address performance improvements.
================

API Changes
------------
1. Created new TranslationTable interface to translate NucleotideSequence
   into AminoAcidSequence.
   
2. Created new IupacTranslationTables enum which has the common Genbank Translation tables.
   Class contains methods to get by name and by genbank table number.
   
3. Removed old Codon class.

4. Removed SequenceBuilder.build(Range) since it was never used.

5. Refactored AminoAcid classes moved AminoAcids helper class to test
   directory and renamed it AminoAcidUtil.
   
6. Removed GlyphCodec.encode(Collection<T> ) and pushed it down to sub-interfaces.

7. Removed NucleotideCodec.encode(Collection<T> ) and all its uses 
   outside of tests.  Created new helper method in test area to perform
   function so it doesn't pollute public API.

8. Created AminoAcidCodec interface, previously was just GlyphCodec<AminoAcid>.

9. Added sortedInsert(value) and sortedRemove(value) to the growableArrays.

10. Made GrowableArrays implement Iterable, created new classes to Iterate over primitive arrays.

11. DefaultAssembledReadBuilder equals() and hashcode() have been changed
    to use only readId and direction which are the only immutable fields.
    Previously used reference field which is mutable and could breaks the
    equals and hashcode contract.
    
12. Changed AssembledReadBuilder to no longer have methods to programatically set the
    reference since it is now done during build time.
    
13. Added support for creating "denovo" contigs without first providing an
    initial consensus sequence.  So far only supported in AceContigBuilders.
    Will add support for others later.
    
14. Changed StreamingIteator.close() to no longer throw IOException this cleans up a
    lot code that uses the new Java 7 try-with-resource.
 
15. Added sortedInsert( int[]) to GrowableIntArray and equivalents to 
    GrowableByteArray, GrowableShortArray and GrowableLongArray.
    
16. Changed ScfChromatogramWriter to accept Chromatogram objects not
    just ScfChromatogram objects.  If the Chromatogram is not
    an ScfChromatogram, then the writer pretends the scf-specific
    fields are blank.
    
17. Deleted AbstractConsensusCaller class; pushed used methods down
    to AbstractChurchhillWatermanConsensusCaller.
    
18. Added TraceArchiveWriter.getNumberOfTracesWritten().
   
Performance Improvements
------------------------
1.  Changed NucleotideSequenceBuilder to track sorted gap offsets while building.
    This takes up slightly more memory when building but will enable optimized object
    creation during the build() step.
    
2.  Performance improvement changed endian of 2 bit nucleotide encodings to
    reduce the amount of computations.

3.  Changed NucleotideSequenceBuilder to use new added 
    sortedInsert(value) and sortedRemove(value) on the growableArrays.

4.  To improve speed of cas2consed, changed casAlignmentBuilder from random
    access into reference sequence to see if value is gap to
    caching the gap offsets and then doing binary search on them. 
    
5.  Improved fake quality ace writing output.

6.  Performance improvement to NucleotideSequenceBuilder.ungap().

7.  Changed DefaultAssembledReadBuilder to no longer store the
    original NucleotideSequence reference field. Since it is no longer
    used outside of the build() method.  This reduces memory footprint
    as well since there are millions of builder objects in memory all 
    with 1 fewer reference saving either 4 or 8 bytes each.
    
8.  Added QualityCodec.toQualityArray() to efficiently create byte array
    where array[i] is the ith quality score.  
    Changed EncodedQualitySequnce.equasl() to be based on
    array which should be faster most of the time (at least for reads).
    
9.  Performance improvement for NucleotideSequenceBuilder.insert() append()
    and prepend() methods when a NucleotideSequence is passed in.  
    Previously method took an Iterable<Nucletoide> to accept both
    Sequences and Collections.  However since NucleotideSequence
    knows how its length and how many gaps it has we can use that 
    information to pre-allocate the internal structures instead of
    possibly re-allocating them many times as the structures grow.
    
10. Performance improvement for NucleotideSequence : 
    changed Sequence gap computation methods to be more efficient.
    NucleotideCodec now computes those values which should be faster 
    than converting to a List<Integer> then iterating over them. 
    Also stops looking as soon as the current gap offset > offset 
    we care about. Which will make it faster to convert between gap 
    and ungapped offsets for low valued offsets where the sequence 
    is very gappy downstream.

11. Performance improvement for NucleotideSequenceBuilder:
    no longer uses BitSet to internally store data since that was very slow.
    Now use GrowableByteArray which is more than 2x faster but
    takes up 2x the memory.  Now each base is 1 byte instead of 
    4 bits while building.  (But when build() is called the base 
    will be 2 or 4 bits depending on context).  
    We can later implement a GrowableHalfByteArray or 
    something similar to do our own bit masking which will
    reduce the memory footprint if memory becomes a problem.
    
12. TextLineParser no longer uses a pushback inputstream but
    instead keeps the extra byte it read in its own memory.  
    This takes up less memory than a pushback inputstream and 
    we only need to check the unread byte once at the beginning
    of every nextLine() instead of while reading each byte with in.read().
     
13. Changed PairwiseAligner TraceBack matrix to pack 4 tracebacks into a single byte.
    This should reduce memory of smith-waterman and needleman wunsch alignments 
    by a factor of 4.  Previously aligning two 30k sequences to each 
    other took almost 2 GB, now its 400MB.
     
14. Changed NucleotideSequenceBuilder.NewValues.insert() to use
    new growableArray.sortedInsert() instead of growableArray.append(int[]); 
    growableArray.sort().  This was revealed to be bottleneck when using a profiler.

Bug Fixes
------------
1. AminoAcidSequenceBuilder.toString() to actually print
   sequence instead of object ref to growable array.

2. BlosomMatrix - Added support for Stop codon.

3. bug fix to GapQualityValueStrategy to fix quality values of reverse complemented reads.

================
Jillion 4.0 RC 2
================

New Features
------------
1.  Added support for new version of CLC .cas file format produced
    by new version of CLC software "clc_mapper".  Previously
    Jillion only supported cas files produced by CLC ref_assemble 
    software.

API Changes
------------
1.  Created ZtrChromatogramParser class to replace old ZtrChromatogramFileParser
    class so the Chromatogram parsers match the other Jillion parser and visitor 
    classes.
    
2.  Created ScfChromatogramParser and AbiChromatogramParser classes to replace
    old ScfChromatogramFileParser and AbiChromatogramParser classes so the 
    Chromatogram parsers match the other Jillion parser and visitor classes.
    
3.  Renamed ChromatogramFileVisitor.visitEndOfTrace() to visitEnd() to be consistent 
    with other Jillion visitors
    
4.  Changed Chromatogram equals contract to require quality values and id are equal as well.

5.  Removed ChromatogramFileVisitor.visitNewTrace() since it was never used by any chromatogram 
    implementations other than as a no-op.
    
6.  Changed Chromatogram.getPositionSequence() to getPeakSequence().

7.  Changed ChromatogramBuilder methods to get /set confidence to get/set qualities.

8.  Changed TasmBuilder.withAvgCoverage(Double) method to be 
    setCoverageInfo(Integer numReads, Double avgCov) so we also set number of reads.  
    Setting numReads to non-null will override the Contig.getNumberOfReads() methods 
    to be whatever you set it to. (helpful for annotation contigs)
    
9.  Changed AbstractTasmFileParser to set coverage info when parsing tasm header 
    and reset it if any reads parsed.  This allows annotation contigs to retain their
    correct # seqs and avgCoverage levels.

10. Added new method TasmContig.isAnnotationContig() to denote if the numRecords and 
    avg coverage or if it was explicitly set or was computed from underlying read info.
    
11. Changed FastaDataStoreBuilder classes to take InputStreams as well as Files.

12. Changed Slice.equals() to allow for SliceElements to be in any order as long as all present.  
    Previously order of elements mattered.

13. renamed Phd.getPositionSequence() Phd.getPeakSequence()

14. Removed TraceDecoderException and TraceEncoderException, 
    everywhere that used these classes now throw./catch IOException instead.

15. Changed AssembledRead.toReferenceOffset() and AssembledRead.toGappedValidRangeOffset()
    to throw IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions instead of IllegalArgumentExceptions if given invalid offsets.
    
16. Added TextLineParser.peekNextLine()

17. Renamed CtgFileWriter to TigrContigFileWriter.

18. Made DefaultPlacedContig package private since it is only 
    created internally by the ScaffoldBuilder objects.
    
19. Moved ScaffoldUtils class out of Jillion since it was never used except by other higher up modules 
    internal to JCVI (it was moved to  one of those modules )
    
20. Added new method Slice.getConsensusCall() which optionally stores the consensus call for that slice needed 
    for new consensus caller implementations, if consensus is not set, then this method returns null.
    Changed SliceMapBuilder with Contig constructors to set each Slice's consensus call to the
    contig consensus.

21. Added method SliceBuilder.getCurrentCoverageDepth().

22. Added constructors and methods to SliceBuilder that take SliceElementFilter to more simply filter elements.

23. Changed CasFileParser constructor to be private added new create static factory method to use instead.

24. Added sort() and binarySerarch() methods to GrowableArrays. 

25. Added clear() method to SequenceBuilders so the same object can be re-used without having
    to create new objects or gc'ing old objects.
    
26. Changed GapQualityValueStrategy to return entire gapped complemented quality sequence all at once instead of one offset at a time since it is computationally intensive
    and most of the time you need the entire sequence anyway (for slice map building).
    
27. Renamed AceFileContigDataStore interface AceFileDataStore to match the respective builder

Performance Improvements
------------------------
1.  Improved performance of gap calculations for NucletoideSequence implementation that only contains ACGTN

2.  Added constant Nucleotide.VALUES which stores a copy of values() as an unmodifiable List so we don't 
    keep having to clone it every time.

3.  improved NucleotideSequence and NucleotideSequenceBuilder processing by
    optimizing bottlenecks detected with profiler.
    
4.  Improved Fastq parsing by reducing the number of objects created during parsing.

5.  Modified ContigBuilders to use new GapQualityValue methods which can compute quality values
    faster than old method. 

6.  Performance improvements to Range construction.

7.  Rewrote NucleotideCodec implementations so that the class that stores each base
    in 4 bits can take advantage of the 'book keeping' information in the header that was
    used in the 2 bit implementations.  This makes computing gapped and ungapped 
    coordinates much faster with only a slight increase in memory usage.  
    This improves cas2consed times by 33%.

Bug Fixes
------------
1. Fixed internal TextLineParser class to correctly compute the 
   current position offset into a file that uses Windows '\r\n' EOLs.  
   This broke index offset datastore implementations on Windows machines.
   
2. MostFrequentBasecallConsensusCaller now uses cumulative quality scores 
   in the event of a tie.
   
3. Fixed bug in ACGTNucleotideCodec which incorrectly computed ungappedLength.

4. Bug fix LargeTasmContigDataStore.iterator() method to return TasmContig instances 
   instead of TasmContigBuilder instances

5. Fixed Bug in Range.iterator() if Range.getEnd() was Long.MAX_VALUE.

6. Fixed bug in DefaultAsmContig to not delete readbuilders during build().  
   This will now let users call built multiple times without errors.
   
7.  Fixed PhdParser and Writer to correctly handle read tags in all allowed locations.

8.  Fixed bug in PhdWriter to write "UNPADDED_READ_POS" instead of "UNGAPPED_READ_POS"

9.  Fixed bugs in AbstractAlignedReadCasVisitor to correctly handle interleaved records.

10. Fixed for phdBall writer to not write out comment "null" if there wasn't any comment.

11. Bug fix for sff parser if sff read did not have quality trimming applied to it.

12.  Fixed Cas2consed to correctly trim sff reads correctly.

13.  Bug fix in NucleotideSequenceBuilder which incorrectly counted N's as 
     ambiguities when determining the codec to use.

14.  Fixed bugs in GapQualityValueStrategy to correctly compute reverse complemented gap values. 

15.  Bug fix to cas2consed to take qualities into account when computing consensus.
