Jillion installation instructions:

Place jillion .jar file on your classpath.

 =======================
| To build from Source: |
 =======================
 
 Jillion uses apache ant to build all source and test files 
 and requires at least Java 6.
 
 Once Java 6+ and ant are installed on your system,
 from the root directory of a Jillion check-out type:
 
 %ant release
 
 This will compile all source files and create a new file in the root directory 
 named "Jillion-${version}.jar"
