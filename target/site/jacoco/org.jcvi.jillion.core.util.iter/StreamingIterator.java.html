/**
 * {@code StreamingIterator} is an
 * {@link Iterator} 
 * that might not have its next element
 * loaded into memory.  {@link StreamingIterator}s
 * are useful when iterating over elements that are 
 * resource intensive so that only as few as the
 * current element need to actually be loaded into memory
 * at one time.  {@link StreamingIterator}s are
 * often used to iterate over records stored in files.
 * Client code must explicitly 
 * {@link #close()} this iterator when done iterating
 * (preferably in a try-finally block) so
 * that any resources used by this iterator
 * can be cleaned up.  Not completely iterating over all the objects in this iterator
 * &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; not calling {@link #close()} could in some implementations 
 * cause memory leaks,
 * deadlocks and/or permanently blocked background threads.
 * Closing a {@link StreamingIterator} before it has
 * finished iterating over all the records
 * will cause {@link #hasNext()}
 * to return {@code false} and {@link #next()}
 * to throw a {@link NoSuchElementException} as if this iterator
 * has finished iterating.
 * &lt;p/&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; some implementations
 * might throw unchecked exceptions in
 * {@link #hasNext()} or {@link #next()}
 * if there are problems fetching the next element
 * to be iterated.
