/**

 * and usually have a file extension of {@literal .tasm}
 * or {@literal .asm}.  The {@literal .asm} extension has been deprecated
 * since it can be easily confused with TIGR Assembler's
 * replacement, Celera Assembler, which also produces
 * assembly files with a {@literal .asm} file extension although the data
 * is encoded completely differently.
