/**
 * This package contains classes to handle  
 * TIGR Assembler formatted assembly files.
 * Files of this type are produced by
 * the legacy  TIGR Assembler
 * and usually have a file extension of .tasm
 * or .asm.  The .asm extension has been deprecated
 * since it can be easily confused with TIGR Assembler's
 * replacement, Celera Assembler, which also produces
 * assembly files with a .asm file extension although the data
 * is encoded completely differently.
